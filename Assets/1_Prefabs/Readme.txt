# Folder:
1_Prefabs

# Purpose:
This is where we will put prefab objects. That is: GameObjects from the scene can be saved as a prefab object. That way, an identical copy can be instantiated in editor or even runtime in game, so long as a reference to the prefab asset is given.

See „Unity Manual -> Prefabs“ for more information.
